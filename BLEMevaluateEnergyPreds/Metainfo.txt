Input:
- consumer
    - naive_predictions.csv
    - LASSO_predictions.csv
    - LSTM_predictions.csv
- prosumer
    - naive_predictions.csv
    - LASSO_predictions.csv

Output:
- boxplots and heatmaps of naive, LASSO, and LSTM model performance according to MAE, MAPE, MASE, RMSE, and NRMSE on 88 consumer data sets
- boxplots and heatmaps of naive, LASSO, and LSTM model performance according to MAE, MASE, and RMSE on 12 prosumer data sets
- tables summarising the model performance across all consumer and prosumer data sets
