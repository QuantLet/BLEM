Published in: 'Forecasting in blockchain-based smart grids: Testing a prerequisite for the implementation of local energy markets'

Description: Simulates the market mechanism (blind double auction), which was implemented by Mengelkamp et al. (2018) in smart contract on a private Ethereum Blockchain, with real consumption and production data in three different supply scenarios (balanced, over-, and undersupply) and with true and predicted energy consumption values.

Keywords: blind double auction, market simulation, energy trading, zero-intelligence traders, smart grid, blockchain, smart contract, market mechanism, market outcome, equilibrium price, line graphs, time series, energy prediction, forecast, prediction error, energy cost, energy supply, energy demand

Input:
- data: 100 consumer and 100 prosumer data sets containing electricity readings in 3-minute intervals (csv-files)
- predictions: 15-minute interval prediction of electricity consumption for every consumer forecasted with LASSO model (csv-file)

Output:
- market outcomes for each trading period (15-minute slots) in the three months testing period. I.e.,
- equilibrium price: the highest price which can still be served given the amounts offered by producers 
- local energy market price: average of equilibrium price and maximum price weighted by kWh amounts traded at the respective price
- bid results for every market participate acting as consumer:
     - consumer ID
     - amount specified by bidder
     - price bid
     - price paid (equilibrium price or maximum price depending on auction outcome)
     - cost in EURct paid by each consumer
- ask results for every market participate acting as producer:
     - producer ID
     - amount specified by sellers
     - price asked
     - price received (equilibrium price or minimum price depending on auction outcome)
     - revenue in EURct received by each producer
- total amount of electricity supplied in trading period
- total amount of electricity demanded in trading period
- oversupply (difference between total supply and total demand)
