Input:
- data: 100 consumer and 100 prosumer data sets containing electricity readings in 3-minute intervals (csv-files)
- predictions: 15-minute interval prediction of electricity consumption for every consumer and of electricity production for prosumer forecasted with LASSO, LSTM, and persistence model (csv-files)

Output: barplots for each forecasting model (LASSO, LSTM, persistence) depicting total over- and underestimation errors for 88 consumer data sets and 12 prosumer data sets
