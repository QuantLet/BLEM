Datafile:
- 100 consumer datasets (named "consumer-00000xxx.csv")
- 100 prosumer datasets (named "producer-00000xxx.csv")

Input: 100 consumer/prosumer data sets containing energy consumption/production in 3-minute intervals for one year (2017).

Output: csv-file containing summary statistics across all consumer/prosumer datasets to generate Latex-table, boxplots of consumer/prosumer's energy consumption/production distribution, barplots of consumer/prosumer's total energy consumption/production in 2017.
