Published in: Forecasting in blockchain-based smart grids: Testing a prerequisite for the implementation of local energy markets

Description: tunes hyperparameters of LSTM recurring neural network, then trains separate LSTM models for 99 consumer and 12 prosumer data sets, uses trained models to make predictions in testing period, and calculates various error measures for model performance

Keywords: household energy prediction, energy consumption, energy production, LSTM, machine learning, hyperparameter tuning, data scaling, error measures, model performance, MAE, MAPE, MASE, RMSE, NRMSE

- logs of training epochs (log-files)
- predictions of energy consumption/production in 15-minute intervals (csv-files)
- error measures calculated on testing data (Rdata-files)
- exemplary plot of data distribution before and after scaling
