Published in: Forecasting in blockchain-based smart grids: Testing a prerequisite for the implementation of local energy markets

Description: Fits LASSO regression models for 99 consumer and 12 prosumer data sets with k-fold cross-validation, uses fitted models to make predictions in testing period and calculates various error measures for model performance.

Keywords: household energy prediction, energy consumption, energy production, LASSO, machine learning, cross-validation, regression model, error measures, model performance, MAE, MAPE, MASE, RMSE, NRMSE

Input: 100 consumer and prosumer datasets containing energy readings for one year (2017) in 3-minute intervals (csv-files)

Output:
- predictions of energy consumption/production in 15-minute intervals (csv-files)
- error measures calculated on testing data (Rdata-files)
